# Shop Inventory

## Overview
A fullstack, full CRUD project that should replicate a shopping website. This project is broken into three phases Inventory Management, User Accounts, and Cart & Orders. The reason these three phases are broken apart is to focus the development efforts and provide an example of feature integrations over the life of a project as it evolves. This first phase is more of an admin panel for managing the inventory of the shop. The second focus' on making an authentication system for users to create an account and login. The third and final phase is the final piece of the puzzle, while it mainly deals with creating a shopping cart system you will also make the market place where users can browse products and add them to their carts.
